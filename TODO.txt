	IMPLEMENTING : Give purpose to caught hiders.

	Hiders escape back to ship (Hider Objective)
		DESC: And the hiders having to escape back to the ship is a good idea,
		I could make it so that after a certain point the exits will be unlocked and the hiders will be notified that they can escape.
		And I also need to make it so that the players are invincible once they are in the ship so it can act like a safe zone.
		(And now that I'm thinking about it, disable flipping the lever to leave early to give the other hiders a chance,
		AND also make the ship automatically leave once all the hiders that are still alive are in the ship.)
