## Description
- v60! *New Abilities* adding spice to the classic hide and seek game!
- A Hide And Seek mod dedicated to making your life easier when it comes to rules and finding the right mods.
- A config allowing a wide range of behaviors allowing the seeker or the hiders to have a slightly better advantage
- Infinite money so you don't have to get a few things back just to go to Titan for a few rounds

## v1.4.0.0 Major update
- Added:
    - Multiple Seekers!
        - There is now a config file for specifying the number of seekers each round, both static (1-4... etc) and scaling (20%-55.55%... etc).
    - Ship Teleporter effects to the Teleport and Swap ability.
    - Username colors for each role (Configurable)
- Changed:
    - Starting item slots can now be randomized! (Config Example, 'Shovel, Yeild Sign, Stop Sign' will have a 1 out of 3 chance for each item)
- Fixed:
    - GetPlayerWithClientId() being inconsistant with some clients.
    - Game soft locking when the seeker dies before the ship lands.
    - Unable to spawn Turrets or Landmines when natural spaning of them is disabled in the config.
    - "You have zero days left to meet the profit quota." What profit quota?
- Balancing:
    - Teleport and Swap
        - Startup cooldown = 3
More to be added...

## Known Mod Conflict Issues
- Currently, using having the 'ModelReplacementApi' mod will break the Invisibility ability, as the models are handled differently. This makes it hard to disable the custom models without a hard and unnecessary dependency on the mod
- It is impossible to use the ability ui in the 'LethalCompanyVR' mod. This is planned to be fixed in a future update though. (I love playing in VR)

## Known Compatible Mods
- More Company
- Late Company
- Reserved Item Slot mods (Just press 'e' a few times to fix the items being locked up)
- More Suits

## Recommended Mods
- More Company (Bigger lobbies)
- Lock_Doors_Mod (Give keys a cool extra mechanic)
- LC Better Clock (Make the time visible at all times)
- Too Many Emotes (Overall makes the game more fun, you wont get rewarded for this type of taunting though)
