- A Hide And Seek mod dedicated to making your life easier when it comes to rules and finding the right mods.
- A config allowing a wide range of behaviors allowing the seeker or the hiders to have a slightly better advantage
- Infinite money so you don't have to get a few things back just to go to Titan for a few rounds

    - 'Maneater Enabled' as a config option
- Changed:
    - 'Teleport seeker to entrance', and 'teleport seeker inside' are now true by default (Changed in config)

    - Descriptions of a few abilities

    - Warning the client at 10 seconds rather than 5 (Invisibility + Stealth)
    - "Collision Cube" appearing on client invisibility expires
    - Flashlight and Walkie sometimes being visible while invisible ability is active (Due to reserved slot mod)

## Known Mod Conflict Issues
- Currently, using having the 'ModelReplacementApi' mod will break the Invisibility ability, as the models are handled differently. This makes it hard to disable the custom models without a hard and unnecessary dependency on the mod
- It is impossible to use the ability ui in the 'LethalCompanyVR' mod. This is planned to be fixed in a future update though. (I love playing in VR)

## Known Compatible Mods
- More Company
- Late Company (There may be a few unknown issues related to this mod, however I've been working to mostly support late player joining)
- Reserved Item Slot mods
- More Suits

## Recommended Mods
- More Company (Bigger lobbies)
- Lock_Doors_Mod (Give keys a cool extra mechanic)
- LC Better Clock (Make the time visible at all times)
- Too Many Emotes (Overall makes the game more fun, you wont get rewarded for this type of taunting though)
