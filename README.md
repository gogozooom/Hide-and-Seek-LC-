# HideAndSeek

## Description
- v60! *New Abilities* adding spice to the classic hide and seek game!
- A Hide And Seek mod dedicated to making your life easier when it comes to rules and finding the right mods.
- A config allowing a wide range of behaviors allowing the seeker or the hiders to have a slightly better advantage
- Infinite money so you don't have to get a few things back just to go to Titan for a few rounds

## v1.3.0 Ability Update
- Added config option to make ship leave earlier (true and 10:00PM by default)
- Added config option to enable infinite flashlight battery (true by default)
- Added a few more taunt sound effects
- Added 'Stealth' and 'Invisibility' as new abilities
- Added categories to keep all the abilities sorted (plus a favorites tab)

- Turrets and Landmines now no longer activate to their creator
- Hoarding Bugs will now give items to their creator and fend of anyone else trying to hinder this process
- Brackens will now ignore their creator
- The Masked will now ignore their creator
- Thumpers will now ignore their creator
- Spellchecked the Changelog and Readme
- Items spawned now enter inventory automatically
- Changed a few ability prices to make more balanced
- Winners now get a good wad of cash after each round
- Dead bodies now have more scrap value (100 by default in config)

- Fixed a few errors when using abilities with certain clients
- Fixed more issues related to the host leaving and creating a new lobby
- Fixed the swap ability breaking when there is only one hider left
- Fixed spawning Turrets/Landmines sometimes having an error
- Fixed tip being able to exclaim "'1' hiders remain"; changed to "'1' hider remains"
- Fixed the first and last taunt sound being less probable to play
- Fixed being able to open the ability menu when you're not supposed to (Using the terminal, Quick menu open)
- Temporarily removed 'Spawn Remote' ability

## Known Mod Conflict Issues
- Currently, using having the 'ModelReplacementApi' mod will break the Invisibility ability, as the models are handled differently. This makes it hard to disable the custom models without a hard and unnecessary dependency on the mod
- It is impossible to use the ability ui in the 'LethalCompanyVR' mod. This is planned to be fixed in a future update though. (I love playing in VR)

## Known Compatible Mods
- More Company
- Late Company (There may be a few unknown issues related to this mod, however I've been working to mostly support late player joining)
- Reserved Item Slot mods
- More Suits

## Recommended Mods
- More Company (Bigger lobbies)
- Lock_Doors_Mod (Give keys a cool extra mechanic)
- LC Better Clock (Make the time visible at all times)
- Too Many Emotes (Overall makes the game more fun, you wont get rewarded for this type of taunting though)
